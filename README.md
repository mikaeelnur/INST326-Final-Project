How to use the habit tracker:
- open the command prompt program
- cd into file location
- python3 habit_tracker.py
- Follow instructions from there!
There are some important factors to remember:
- The habits.txt file should be in the same folder as the .py file
- If there is not an existing habits.txt file, the program will create a new one
- When logging progress for a file, make sure to type it exactly how it was typed when adding it
- Ex. if you added “morning walk” to the habits list, when it asks you which habit you want to log, you should type it exactly, “morning walk”.
